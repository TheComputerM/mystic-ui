# Mystic UI

Components that fill the gap of *cool and beautiful components* in the **SolidJS** ecosystem. Crafted with care using **TailwindCSS**, **PandaCSS** and **Motion One**.

## Features

- **Compatible with both Tailwind and Panda** - Use with the css framework of your choice!
- **Copy+Paste Components** - As simple as it sounds.
- **CLI Support** - Add Mystic components to your projects even faster.
- **TypeScript** - Get all the intellisense you want.

## Why?

I think by now we all know how important a good UI is for websites and applications. It's the first thing users see and it's the first thing they interact with, so it's important to get it right.

Inspite of that, I would rather focus on buiding the *heart* of the software, I guess that's why component libraries such as [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Park UI](https://park-ui.com/) are so popular, they allow developers to focus on the core of their software while resting assured in the fact that users will have a good first impression.

That's why I made **Mystic UI**, because currently there is no collection of *cool and beautiful components* for the SolidJS ecosystem, and I think it's important to have one.

## PRs Welcome

If you want to see a component here, open an issue or create a PR. Sometimes it gets tough with just a single guy maintaining a huge project, so any help is appreciated.
