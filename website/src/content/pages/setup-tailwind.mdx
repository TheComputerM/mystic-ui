# Setup with Tailwind

You can use Mystic UI with your Tailwind projects, also works with tailwind based frameworks like [Solid UI](https://www.solid-ui.com/) and [shadcn-solid](https://shadcn-solid.com/).

Run `npx mystic-ui@latest init` with whatever package manager you prefer and make sure you choose *tailwind* as your css framework. You will have to add the `cn` utility manually where you specify the utils path alias.

```sh
npm i clsx tailwind-merge
```

```ts
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
}
```
