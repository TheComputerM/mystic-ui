# Setup with Tailwind

You can use Mystic UI with your Tailwind projects, also works with tailwind based frameworks like [Solid UI](https://www.solid-ui.com/) and [shadcn-solid](https://shadcn-solid.com/).

Run `npx @mystic-ui/cli init` with whatever package manager you prefer and make sure you choose *tailwind* as your css framework. This will add the `cn` utility, otherwise you will have to add it manually.
